This is my first React project, so be nice.  It's intended to be a timer for the exercises
the physical therapist gave me.  One minute on one leg, 15 seconds off while switching legs,
one minute on, etc etc.

I was annoyed the app would go to sleep while I was working out, so I added the 'No Sleep' toggle.

You can see it running here (probably): https://timer.henkelsoft.com/
